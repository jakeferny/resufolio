        My first project with the <a id="linx", href="asat.html">AlbertaSat</a> team was Dedicated Electron Balloon Observatory for Radiation 
        Belt Analysis (DEBORA) mission. My primary role on this team was developing a chasis for the payload, which was built to study Bremstrahhlung X-rays 
        in the stratosphere. I also performed preliminary buoyancy calculations to size the balloon and helium requirements. 
        Read more about the mission itself <a id = "linx", href="https://albertasat.ca/balloon-mission/">here</a> on the

        Chasis design involved a rigorous design process to ensure that deliverables 
        were met. The chasis had to be designed such that the sensitive sensors and computers remained at
        an appropriate temperature, the equipment could survive an impact with the ground at high speeds, and that
        the components were held in place throughout the balloon's mission. CAD software SolidWorks was utilized to build 
        prototypes and develop an idea of where components belong. My primary role was to ideate chasis designs and simulate
        the models and test the prototypes.

        The bulk of my testing was to ensure that the components inside the chasis remained at an appropriate thermal level
         throughout the flight. This was done first by formulating general heat flux loss equations given varying materials and 
         geometry. Prototypes were also placed in thermal chambers with sensors to measure the heat losses expected. Metal, plastics, composites, and even wood were all considered as potential materials, but in the end a foam box
         proved to be the simplest and cheapest design. The final fabrication and testing occured after my time on the balloon mission team,
         and the mission was finally launched on May 11th 2024 during an intense solar storm to massive success. See images from the
         mission below.
